Security is of paramount importance when developing a web or mobile application
and usually consists of two distinct pieces:

- Authentication
- Authorization

Authentication is a process of verifying someone's identity before a protected
resource is accessed.

Authorization is a process of deciding if a user can perform an action on a
protected resource.

This document gives you an overview of the authentication system provided in
LoopBack 4.

Let's start with the following scenario: Suppose you want to secure endpoint
`GET /todo` using
[JWT(JSON web token)](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#readme)
strategy, the diagram below shows how such authentication process works with
LoopBack's authentication mechanism.

![authentication_overview_request_handle_flow](./imgs/authentication/authentication-overview.png)

As you can see, a request with token in its header reaches the application. It's
handled by the REST server's sequence, which invokes the authentication action
to decode the user profile from token so that controller can inject the user
into its functions. All you need to do is the code in programming colors:

- Register the authentication component and JWT extension in your application.
- Enable the authenticate action in sequence.
- Decorate the controller endpoint with `@authenticate()` and inject the user
  passed from the authentication layer.

The rest will be handled by our authentication component
`@loopback/authentication`, which glues all the parts together, and the JWT
extension `@loopback/jwt-authentication`, which is usually provided by extension
developers.

The authentication system is highly extensible and plugible. It's easy to get
started with. While there are more advanced features to explorer, and they
benefit when you build more complicated and larger scale applications. This
requires you to understand the mechanism of the sysmte, like how component
`@loopback/authentication` works. To help you learn the full features gradually,
we break down the documentations into several parts:

- [JWT todo example](missing_link): A tutorial to get started by applying the
  JWT authentication in the
  [todo example](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/todo-tutorial.html).
- Understand the modules provided out-of-the-box:
  - [Authentication component](missing_link): A deep dive of component
    `@loopback/authentication`
  - [JWT extension](missing_link): A prototype implementation of the JWT
    authentication.
- [How to create your own authentication strategy](missing_link): Particularly
  for extension developers.
- [Use [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport) strategies](missing
  link): The usage of passport adapter module
  `@loopback/authentication-passport`.
